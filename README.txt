## Application:

The file "Data.csv" includes a simulated data set with the number of groups being 7000 and two covariates.

The main program is in file "Analysis File.txt", which can produce the covariate effect estimates, standard error estimates, and p-values. 

Some necessary functions are given in the file "Support functions.txt".

One needs to put the "Support functions.txt" and "Data.csv" files in the working directory before running the main program in file "Analysis File.txt".
